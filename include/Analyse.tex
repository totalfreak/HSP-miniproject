\chapter{Theory}
	Going through the theory in the book \textit{Sensation and perception}, to categorize the different depth cues a tree was made, and to give structure to my essay, I remade a copy of it as seen \autoref{fig:depthCues}, and will utilize this for presenting my findings and answering the topic questions.
